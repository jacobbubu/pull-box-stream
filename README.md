> A starter project that makes creating a TypeScript module extremely easy.

## Intro.

This tool is a modification of [typescript-library-starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter), I'm using it to create Node.JS modules.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacobbubu/typescript-starter.git YOURFOLDERNAME
cd YOURFOLDERNAME
npm install
```

**Start coding!** `package.json` and entry files are already set up for you, so don't worry about linking to your main file, typings, etc. Just keep those files with the same name.

## Features

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification. Contributions of any kind are welcome!
